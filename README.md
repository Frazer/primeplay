A tool for investigating and finding primes


I just discovered this is a slightly optimized version of the Sieve of Eratosthenes
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes


The extra digits that are printed represent how far between factors of the left over sieve numbers.
As you can see there is a clear pattern for 2,3,5 and 7.  I was hoping this program would reveal further patterns... no such luck.
